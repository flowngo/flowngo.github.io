AMERICA'S increasingly volatile and belligerent politics, hastened by
racial and social grievances of conservative white Americans, now manifests
itself in the Supreme Court’s poise to overturn Roe v. Wade. After around
five decades of the guaranteed federal constitutional protection of
abortion rights, society now looks at going back to the pre-1973 era. This
places anti-Roe conservatives on a collision course with those comfortable
with the changes remarking the 21st century America.

As the polls suggest, overturning Roe, while framed as a pro-life act, in
reality, is another attempt to challenge the modern views of
kaleidoscopically diverse younger generations born after 1980, representing
the <a class="nice-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/now-more-than-half-of-americans-are-millennials-or-younger/">majority of Americans</a>. Those who want to make abortion illegal, for
example, consistently express much more skepticism about <a class="nice-link" target="_blank" href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/1647-supermajority-survey-on-women/429aa78e37ebdf2fe686/optimized/full.pdf">changing gender
roles</a>; they are more likely to believe that the U.S. will not benefit from
more women in power. More than <a class="nice-link" target="_blank" href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/1647-supermajority-survey-on-women/429aa78e37ebdf2fe686/optimized/full.pdf">80%</a> of abortion opponents think that
discrimination against white Americans is now a big problem; about <a class="nice-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.prri.org/research/competing-visions-of-america-an-evolving-identity-or-a-culture-under-attack/">60%</a>
agree that things have changed to the point that they feel like strangers
in their own country.

This divide further extends in how red and blue states are responding to
the changes. Of the 12 red states that have passed new abortion
restrictions since 2021, nine have denied <a class="nice-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2022/05/supreme-court-overturn-roe-v-wade-no-rape-incest-exceptions/629747/">exceptions for rape and incest</a>,
if Roe falls. Meanwhile, 16 Democratic states together with the District of
Columbia have laws in place to protect abortion rights, if Roe is
overturned. Thus, reversing Roe v. Wade can make the Republican-Democratic
divide starker.

Nevertheless, <a class="nice-link" target="_blank" href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1576/abortion.aspx">80%</a> of Americans
are pro-abortion with <a class="nice-link" target="_blank" href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3828">63%</a> supporting Roe v.
Wade, which means that the Republican-appointed Supreme Court majority will
continue to find itself at odds with the priorities of America’s modern
generation.
