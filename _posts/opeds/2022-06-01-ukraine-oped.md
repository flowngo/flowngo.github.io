TODAY, as senior U.S. and Russian diplomats conduct negotiations over the
100 thousand Russian troops massed on Ukraine’s eastern border, the Ukraine
crisis tops the list of U.S. security threats. By using disruptive tactics,
Moscow once again attempts to regain its control over the post-Soviet
countries and restore the pre-Cold War security architecture.

The United States and its allies, meanwhile, try to mitigate tensions
between Russia and Ukraine, while maintaining the western sphere of
influence in Eastern Europe. To thwart Moscow’s ambitions, the U.S., and
the west by extension, have two unpropitious strategic options: (1) to
continue imposing economic sanctions which previously have not produced
long-term results; and (2) to provide military support to Ukraine, if
needed, and risk a large-scale conflict escalation between great powers.
The difficult choice between the two unfavorable options places Washington
in a diplomatic deadlock, which may loosen the U.S. government’s control
over transatlantic security.

To prevent Russia from attacking Ukraine, the U.S. and its allies have
already threatened Moscow with acute sanctions. The U.S. Secretary of State
Antony Blinken expressed his intent to find a diplomatic solution to the
issue; but if diplomacy fails, the western officials announced to
<a class="nice-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/08/us/politics/us-sanctions-russia-ukraine.html">“cut off
Russia’s largest financial institutions from global transactions, impose an
embargo on American-made or American-designed technology needed for
defense-related and consumer industries.”</a> However, sanctions have not
scared Russia off previously, and the odds that they will this time may not
be too high.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei A. Ryabkov clarified</a> that President
Vladimir Putin’s government is not willing to change the course of action
until NATO returns to the positions it held before 1997. In pursuit of this
ambitious goal, Moscow has disregarded many diplomatic agreements and
penalties. With the 2014 annexation of Crimea, Moscow violated the
<a class="nice-link" target="_blank" href="https://treaties.un.org/Pages/showDetails.aspx?objid=0800000280401fbb">1994
Budapest Memorandum</a> in which Russia, along with the U.S. and the U.K.,
pledged to uphold Ukraine’s territorial integrity in exchange for its
nuclear disarmament. The subsequent raft sanctions that the U.S. and its
allies imposed on Moscow triggered the
<a class="nice-link" target="_blank"
href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/18/russia-rouble-threat-nine-countries-remittances">
Russian Ruble crisis</a> in 2015.

However, the outcome was not severe enough to prevent the
<a class="nice-link" target="_blank"
href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/russias-military-buildup-near-ukraine-is-an-open-secret-11641292202">
Russian military buildup near Ukraine</a>, which might cause military incursion between the two
countries yet again.

Regardless of the sanctions, Moscow has successfully
rebuilt its economy before</a>, and it could do it again.

Another possibility for the U.S. is to provide weapons to Ukraine and
contribute troops if the conflict aggravates. With the Kremlin broadcasting
a new round of military exercises within striking distance from Ukraine,
Washington has already made a shipment of weapons to Kyiv.

The Biden administration</a> further suggested that U.S. troops would be deployed soon to
strengthen the allies’ defense capacity in the Baltics and Eastern Europe.

Washington has signaled the western determination to protect Ukraine and
the Euro-Atlantic zone; but
<a class="nice-link" target="_blank"
href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/24/can-the-us-and-europe-stop-russia-from-attacking-ukraine.html">
the allies have not agreed</a> on how far they are
willing to go to defend Ukraine.
<a class="nice-link" target="_blank"

Germany, for example, has refused to
provide military assistance to Ukraine</a> and support sanctions against
Russia, its largest natural gas supplier. The U.S., European, Ukrainian,
and Russian leaders all understand how high the stakes are in this crisis.
The U.S. and European military involvement could aggravate the conflict to
a great power war that “could change the world” once again.

Russia’s aggression in Ukraine has triggered the greatest crisis in the
Euro-Atlantic zone since the Cold War. The security architecture that
<a class="nice-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/declassified_139339.htm">NATO</a>
has been trying to build since 1949 is challenged, and the United States
has a pivotal role in settling this geopolitical conundrum. In case of an
armed conflict, the U.S. will be left to choose between the less impactful
sanctions or a calamitous war. Either can jeopardize the U.S. influence in
the Black Sea region, making this crisis significantly important for the
country’s national security.
