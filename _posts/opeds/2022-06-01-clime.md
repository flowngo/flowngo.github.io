EARLIER this year, the United Nations Development Program published the
world’s largest public opinion
<a class="nice-link" target="_blank"
href="https://www.undp.org/press-releases/worlds-largest-survey-public-opinion-climate-change-majority-people-call-wide-ranging-action">
survey</a> on climate change. According to the
findings, a belief in the climate emergency is strongest among the
population of high-income countries in Western Europe and North America.
Most of the population in these regions also call for immediate climate
action. However, support for environmental policies is below average in
middle-income and least developed countries.

So, why is climate change palpable for the wealthy but not so much for the
developing?

Researchers have
<a class="nice-link" target="_blank"
href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165176513001997">
long pointed out</a> that people worry far less about climate
change when they do not have more immediate needs satisfied, such as
healthcare, jobs, or even sustenance. Another UN survey shows that when
people are asked to prioritize their quotidian needs (e.g., good education,
affordable nutrition, protection against crime and violence), climate
change ranks absolute last for low-income societies. Middle-income
countries assign relatively more importance to the issue. However, unlike
developing societies, about half of respondents in wealthy states think
that climate action is more pressing than gender equality, job
opportunities, internet, and better transportation.

Maslow’s famous
<a class="nice-link" target="_blank"
href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html">
hierarchy of needs</a> can help us make sense of this trend.

According to Maslow’s conception, we first need to satisfy our physical
needs, like hunger and thirst. Once those are satisfied, we move up to
safety, economic and physical security. And we gradually reach the
pinnacle, which is self-actualization - living in a way that expresses our
authentic selves.

Just like individuals, societies also have their collective hierarchy of
needs.

For example, in
<a class="nice-link" target="_blank"
href="https://www.worldvision.org/clean-water-news-stories/10-worst-countries-access-clean-water">
Mozambique and Niger</a>, more than half of the population, do
not have clean water. Dirty water also makes them prone to diseases such as
diarrhea and cholera, placing healthcare and water supply high on the
agenda.

These two also do not have reliable energy at home, like many other African
countries. According to USAID, only 29% of people in
<a class="nice-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.usaid.gov/powerafrica/mozambique">Mozambique</a> have access
to electricity because of limited distribution networks and unfavorable
market conditions. This number is as low as 11.2% in
<a class="nice-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.usaid.gov/powerafrica/niger">Niger</a>. This limited
<a class="nice-link" target="_blank"
href="https://ourworldindata.org/fossil-fuels">energy supply that Africa
has</a>,
comes almost entirely from fossil fuels,
which are the main contributors to
<a class="nice-link" target="_blank"
href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/global-warming-overview">global
warming</a>
and <a class="nice-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/topic/climate-change">climate change</a>.
Those African countries which consume
<a class="nice-link" target="_blank"
href="https://ourworldindata.org/fossil-fuels">less than 15%</a>
of nonrenewable energy,
simply do not have electricity.

Middle-income countries which are a step higher on Maslow’s pyramid, also
prioritize affordable goods and physical safety over green energy. Georgia,
for instance, has long enjoyed round-the-clock electricity and access to
clean water, but it cannot afford to invest billions in wind turbines and
solar panels. Thus, Georgians prefer fossil energy because of its low price
and already existing infrastructure, which does not require exorbitant
investments.

Developing countries can only implement green alternatives to fossil with
generous financial support from developed ones. And many wealthy states
already provide such assistance.

In 2013, USAID launched the
<a class="nice-link" target="_blank"
href="https://www.usaid.gov/powerafrica/aboutus">Power Africa program</a>,
which committed more than
$1 billion to supply the continent with cleaner and more reliable
electricity. The UN’s
<a class="nice-link" target="_blank"
href="http://www.asiapacificadapt.net/about-apan/">Asia Pacific Adaptation
Network (APAN)</a>
supports Asian
governments and other organizations by sharing best practices on climate
change adaptation. The Paris Agreement, signed in 2015 by 196 countries,
acknowledged that developed states need to finance developing ones to use
more renewable energy and keep global warming below 2°C.

But these efforts are not enough. Wealthy polluters, which export or
consume most fossil fuels, first need to abandon environmentally harmful
practices at home.

Norway, for instance, one of the first nations to ratify the Paris
Agreement, is also
<a class="nice-link" target="_blank"
href="https://www.norskpetroleum.no/en/production-and-exports/exports-of-oil-and-gas/">the
world’s third largest gas exporter</a>
after Russia and
Qatar. The country significantly benefits from exporting oil and gas, and
never declared the intention to stop doing so despite their grave impact on
climate change. In fact, in 2019 Norway opened
<a class="nice-link" target="_blank"
href="https://www.equinor.com/energy/johan-sverdrup">
its third-largest oil field in the North Sea</a>,
which
<a class="nice-link" target="_blank"
href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/19/business/norway-oil-field-climate-change-intl/index.html">
critics</a> perceived as a quintessence of climate hypocrisy.

In the United States, one of the largest polluter countries, big businesses
hinder the nation from meeting its 2025 climate goal to reduce emissions by
26-28%. Companies like Apple, Amazon, Walmart, and dozens of others, invest
in
<a class="nice-link" target="_blank"
href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/10/big-companies-are-funding-campaign-kill-climate-bill/620278/">
lobbying to kill the bill</a> that aims to
<a class="nice-link" target="_blank" href="https://rhg.com/research/build-back-better-congress-budget/">eliminate nearly 1 billion tons
of carbon</a> in the next decade. The reason is simple – new environmental
regulations place significant financial interests at stake, and wealthy
companies are not willing to lose their profits.

Cash plays a central role in climate action. While developing economies
cannot afford to combat climate change, developed ones are not ready to
risk their earnings and take bold steps to reduce pollution.

Still, responsibility mostly falls on wealthy countries to fight global
warming domestically and internationally. It is not only because they have
financial resources to do so, but also because they are the largest
polluters who benefit the most from nonrenewable energy.
