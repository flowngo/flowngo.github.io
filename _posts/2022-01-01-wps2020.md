The Women, Peace and Security (WPS) Tbilisi International Conference 2020
aimed to mark the 20th anniversary of the UN Security Council Resolution
(UNSCR) 1325 on WPS. The Resolution reaffirms and promotes women’s
indispensable inclusion in both civilian and military realms of the defense
sector. The goal was to highlight the progress after the UNSCR 1325 and
discuss the future implications of the Resolution. In doing so, we hosted
several panels with the participation of prominent field professionals and
practitioners as well as aspiring students and recent graduates.

WPS Tbilisi 2020 was organized by the FLOW co-founders on the American
Corner Tbilisi’s platform. The conference was fully funded by the U.S.
Embassy in Tbilisi, Georgia. We thank the project partners: National Youth
and Children’s Palace of Georgia, American University in Bulgaria (AUBG),
Junior Diplomat Initiative (JDI), and Bringing Europeans Together
Association (BETA).
