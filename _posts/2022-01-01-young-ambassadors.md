## ***Apply to join us***

FLOW is looking for enthusiastic volunteers who are passionate about Peace
& Security, Community Empowerment, Economic Sustainability, Climate Change,
Tech & Innovation.

We offer our Ambassadors extensive training in change-making and project
management, and give them one-year mandate to execute community-oriented
initiatives under our umbrella.

FLOW Ambassadors work closely with the board of CEOs and the members of
American Corner Tbilisi to deliver projects within the five areas of our
focus.

We aim to equip our Ambassadors with relevant toolkitsÂ and critical
thinking skills to make impact within their communities.
