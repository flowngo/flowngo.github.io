## Who we are

FLOW was founded by two best friends, Ketevan Chincharadze and Davit
Gambashidze, and their mentor, Natela Urushadze, during the Covid-19
lockdown in 2020.

Their friendship, partnership, and cooperation began in 2012, at the
American Corner Tbilisi, which is the U.S. State Department’s platform to
promote democratic ideals in Georgia’s capital. Ketevan and Davit were two
of the most driven, creative, and hardworking students at the Corner-
always challenging themselves and looking for opportunities to improve.
Natela Urushadze, the Corner’s award-winning coordinator and Georgia’s
acclaimed mentor of dozens of change-makers, immediately noticed the two
students’ talent and worked with them to push through various successful
initiatives.

Their team of three won two short documentary contests of the U.S. Embassy
in Tbilisi, designed innovative summer school programs, started
student-authored journals, contributed to the development of the
Israeli-Georgian cultural exchange program, and championed many American
Corner’s traditions, some of which are now encoded in the U.S. State
Department’s guidelines. Because of their significant contributions, the
U.S. Embassy in Georgia designed Ketevan and Davit as honorable alumni and
recognized Natela Urushadze as the best American Coordinator across the
country.

After Ketevan and Davit both went to study abroad and pursue their dreams
after graduating high school. They continued keeping in touch with Natela
Urushadze and mentoring younger generations of the American Corner. The
experience of working from different countries inspired them to start a
global nonprofit which would promote the idea of open world and allow
different peoples to unite around pressing challenges regardless of their
age and nationality.

They developed the concept of FLOW and launched it during the pandemic
lockdown. Since then, FLOW has been building bridges and zealously
promoting experience-sharing across nations and generations.
